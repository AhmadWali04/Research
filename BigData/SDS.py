"""
Take our X_i, create all pairs of their values (len (X_i) choose 2)
calculate the difference of those pairs through our modular equation
add it to our new set
take the union of all X_i
pop out values from the union of sets, constructing copies of our sets (check if its a copy)
if we have lambda copies, valid SDS
Methodology:
I initially tried to make it so I was creating lambda arrays and seeing if we had lambda copies but that was
horribly inneficient, I instead changed my appraoch to checking if I have lambda copies of each element, which is sufficient
to prove I have enough elements to create lambda sets with all unique elements.

    Determine whether the given collection of sets forms a valid SDS (t-{v; k1,...,kt; 位} supplementary difference sets).
    
    Parameters:
    - v (int): The modular base for our ring Z_v
    - lam (int): The parameter 位, representing how many final copies we should have
    - X_sets (list of sets of int): A list of t subsets (S1, S2, ..., St) 
    
    Returns:
    - bool: True if the sets in X_sets form an SDS with parameters (v; k1,...,kt; 位), False otherwise.
