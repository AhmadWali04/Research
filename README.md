# Research
A respository to help show the code and work I've developed for research projects, primarily working with Dr. Ilias Kotserias &amp; Shohini Ghose at WLU under the CARGO lab

## Quantum Computing
This repository holds a prelude document to beginning my research, where I discuss my interest in studying the Variational Quantum Eigensolver. More documents will be added as research progresses
